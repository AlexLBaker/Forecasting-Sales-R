# Forecasting-Sales-R
Repository provides a systematic approach for forecasting sales data based on historical quarterly sales figures. Different time series models are explored, and the best model is selected based on its performance on a validation set. The forecast is then visualized as a probability density function (PDF), and weighted averages for different sales regions are calculated based on the PDF.

Necessary package installation code:

install.packages(c("readxl", "dplyr", "lubridate", "zoo", "forecast"))
